//Certain creeps have target .x/.y positions in their memory.
//This allows for flipping them from one path to another when they hit that position.
//These will have to be preserved or accounted for when switching to the new pathing.
harvester uses []mfat (which should only be one element).
mtransport and builder uses []mine.slice(-1).
ubuilder (unused), upgrader, and utransport use []upgrade.slice(-1).
upgrader code also uses []upgrade.slice(-1).
transport code also uses []upgrade.slice(-1).
builder also uses []defpaths[need].slice(-1).
dbuilder uses the full []mine with concat []defpaths[need] as a movenow.
dbuilder also uses slice(-1) from this movenow.
